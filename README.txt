My TravelSite theme with Materialize CSS 1.0.0

In this project I built a one page layout website using only the Materialize JavaScript and Vanilla JS.

I learned a lot by utilizing plugins like Scrollspy, Material Box, Slider and Sidenav to have some form of interaction within the site. 

It is also responsive and mobile friendly so the TravelSite will adjust itself on smaller devices while maintaining the functionality. The layout might change slightly such as the navBar will turn into a hamburger menu on smaller screen size.
